# Near Horizon

**[nearhorizon.org](https://nearhorizon.org)**

We use technology and design to test and scale appropriate solutions that build resilient communities.

## The Problem

In the 1960s, Buckminster Fuller described humanity's task of piloting "Spaceship Earth." Communities today face compounding challenges around fundamental needs as the planet exceeds numerous planetary boundaries. At the same time, we have never been better equipped with the knowledge, technologies, and resources to achieve Fuller's goal of "making the world work for 100% of humanity... without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone."

Technology often isn't serving humanity. Instead we get flashy products misaligned with what it takes to build thriving communities. These trends are poised to accelerate as artificial intelligence and real-world robotics scale. If communities do not create local capacity to metabolize innovation with the explicit purpose of benefiting humanity, we will likely see increased inequality, wealth concentration, and deeper tears in the community fabric.

## What is Near Horizon?

Near Horizon is a physical design and prototyping facility in Lancaster, PA filled with the people, tools, and resources to build a resilient future -- focused on community-scale challenges.

People design and prototype solutions, fabricate projects, and test business models in the physical space and in the real world. It attracts curious innovators and organizational collaborators who question existing paradigms and develop novel solutions. Through social media, the world is invited into the lab. Ideas are exchanged to grow necessary solutions with speed.

## Resilience Pillars

Our work is organized around five community-scale resilience pillars:

| Pillar | Goal |
|---|---|
| **Energy Independence** | Energy needs are met with locally produced, renewable energy |
| **Food Security** | Everyone has access to healthy, local, regeneratively grown food |
| **Carbon Neutrality** | Achieve net-zero emissions by cutting pollution and restoring natural systems |
| **Ecological Regeneration** | Ecosystems are prepared for tomorrow's climate |
| **Thriving Communities** | All communities are empowered and included in shaping a just future |

## Values

- **Affordability** -- Solutions must be within reach of the people that need them most
- **Openness / DIY** -- Create replicable solutions and the services to help people implement
- **Scalability** -- Ideal problems are faced by many communities/stakeholders, not a single entity
- **Decentralization** -- Solutions oppose further concentration of power and wealth
- **Abundance over scarcity** -- Design to create a world where there is enough for all
- **Solarpunk over degrowth** -- Imagine a future where high tech and high ecological awareness coexist

## Business Model

The lab evolves as a collaboration among individuals and organizations working toward shared resilience goals. It offers shared space, tools, and resources for building and prototyping, reducing costs and avoiding redundant investments for members. While members primarily pursue their own projects, the core value lies in its network: a creative community of innovators with diverse skills and perspectives. By fostering reciprocal knowledge exchange, the lab enables members to quickly overcome technical and strategic hurdles, draw on collective expertise, and produce stronger, more scalable outcomes than would be possible in isolation.

### Revenue

- **Short term:** Individual members are responsible for their own project budgets
- **Long term:** Build a YouTube/social media audience of people eager for climate solutions. Empower them to replicate solutions. Offer consulting services for people who find this content but need help with implementation

### Intellectual Property

Collaborating individuals and organizations maintain ownership of IP they create at Near Horizon -- but the goal is to share. Ideal projects are complex challenges that benefit from a network of creative individuals rather than cloistered teams focused on privacy and beating opponents to market. Success generates ideas to scale solutions larger than any individual company could deliver, while creating revenue-generating opportunities for implementation.

Near Horizon has a YouTube channel at [youtube.com/@nearhorizon](https://youtube.com/@nearhorizon), created with the email info@nearhorizon.org.

## Origins

Founded by Eric Sauder and Caleb Bornman in December 2025, Near Horizon began as the Local Resilience Lab -- a response to the growing gap between technological capability and community wellbeing.

The name is multifold. A call for optimism when the view ahead is haze. A focus on the local, practical, achievable -- solutions communities can take up now. And yet, horizons reach far into the distance.
